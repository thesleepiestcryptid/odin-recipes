            <p>
                This is a family favorite recipe that we make for the
                holidays. We don't do traditional foods on holidays, 
                instead we make different types of dishes.<br> We make black bean
                enchiladas for our vegetarian family members and refried beans 
                as well.

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cut chicken breasts into 1 inch strips. Place
                        in a medium bowl with desired marinade, and marinate in
                        the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute chicken and onions
                        until chicken is evenly brown. Stir in diced tomatoes with green chile peppers,<br>
                        stewed tomatoes, chile peppers, soup, broth and taco seasoning. Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce
                        heat, cover skillet, and simmer for 20-30 minutes or until chicken is no <br>longer
                        pink and the juices run clear.</li>
                        <li>Remove chicken from skillet, and shred when cool enough to handle. Meanwhile,
                        allow skillet mixture to simmer and reduce to about 2 1/4 cups. <br>In a medium bowl,
                        combine shredded chicken and about 1/4 cup skillet mixture (just enough to make a
                        paste-like mixture).<br>Mix together with half the chopped green onions. Pour the
                        remaining 2 cups of skillet mixture into a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                        <li>In a second skillet, heat cream over low heat, being careful not to boil. Dip
                        tortillas in warm cream to soften and coat. Spoon about 1/3 cup chicken mixture<br>
                        onto each tortilla. Top chicken mixture with half the shredded cheese, and roll
                        up tortillas. Place rolled tortillas in baking dish, seam side down, and drizzle<br>
                        with enchilada sauce. Cover with remaining cheese, and sprinkle remaining chopped
                        green onion over cheese. Bake uncovered in preheated oven for 25 minutes, or<br>
                        until cheese is melted and bubbling.</li>
